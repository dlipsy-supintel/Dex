# 05-Resources — Daily plan context

This folder holds **reference material to incorporate into your daily plan**: checklists, one-pagers, links, or short docs you want surfaced when running `/daily-plan`.

**Use it for:**
- Reusable checklists (e.g. launch checklist, meeting prep template)
- One-page references (priorities, key metrics, decision criteria)
- Links or notes you want considered during planning

**How it’s used:** When generating a daily plan, Dex can pull context from here (e.g. “today’s focus” reminders or recurring prep items) so the plan stays aligned with how you work.

Add files or subfolders as you like; structure is up to you.
